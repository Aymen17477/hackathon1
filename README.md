#COLLEGE SPORTS FACILITIES RESERVATION SYSTEM

A web-app to reserve sport facilites 

Problem Statement 1.6: Open Innovation (Level 1)

Category: Free Choice

##DESCRIPTION

With the construction of the new courts, we discovered that conflicts arose between students attempting to play simultaneously, so we developed a system that provides an organized solution to this issue. There is no centralized, real-time system in place at colleges to handle reservations for sports facilities. Students struggle to reserve slots, check availability, and coordinate with other players, which results in scheduling conflicts.


##SOLUTION:

A web-based sports facility booking system. Students can log in, browse sports facilities, view available slots, book courts/fields, and manage their bookings.They can also cancel the bookings and look at if other slots are booked to avoid double booking

##FEATURES:

+User Signup & Login system

+Browse sports facilities by sport type

+View available time slots (9 AM – 9 PM)

+Book a slot instantly

+View all bookings in "My Bookings"

+Cancel bookings anytime

+Easy Navigation across the website

+SQLite database storage


##TECH STACK:


+Backend: Python (Flask)

+Frontend: HTML and CSS (Jinja Templates)

+Database: SQLite3


##SETUP PROCESS:

Create a repo on github


Clone the repo


Activate the virtual environment


Install dependencies using the requirements file


Run the application


Execute python app.py to start the Flask server


Access the site


##Learnings and Challeneges

+ Trouble with pushing and pulling changes

+ Differentiating between local and remote repositories

+ As first year college students navigating and figuring out git and github 

+ Difficulties with branches 

+ In the end we learnt a lot and became familiar with github
  
+  We learnt to implement flask, a database software and revisited html

+ A lot alignment issues we had to solve, multiple times the webapp breaking down
